# 🧠 AsmOSx86  
*A Hobbyist Operating System in x86 Assembly*

AsmOSx86 is a 32-bit x86 operating system written entirely in NASM assembly and designed to run  
in protected mode. Its long-term goal is to provide a fully preemptive, priority-based multitasking  
kernel with a clear, minimal, and educational design.

---

## 🧱 OS Design
- Monolithic kernel  
- Preemptive multitasking  
- Priority-based scheduling  

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- Windows 11  
- x86 assembly language  

## 🧮 Target Hardware
- x86 architecture (e.g., Intel 386)  

## 🔧 Toolchain
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)  
- PowerShell scripting  

## 🚀 Execution Environment
- Bochs emulator  
- Real x86 hardware (e.g., 386 PC)

## 📚 Project Documentation
Project documentation lives in the Doc folder and provides the context needed to
understand the design and structure of AsmOSx86.

The code itself is heavily commented; taken together, the source and the documentation
should give you everything required to understand how the system works and to modify
it into whatever you want it to become.

The Tutorial is a work in progress...
