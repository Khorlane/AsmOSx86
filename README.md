# 🧠 AsmOSx86  
*A Hobbyist Operating System in x86 Assembly*

**AsmOSx86** is a hands-on exploration of 32-bit protected mode OS development, written entirely in x86 assembly. It’s designed to help you understand the low-level mechanics of operating systems — from bootloaders to kernel scheduling — by building everything from scratch.

---

## 🧱 OS Design
- Monolithic kernel
- Preemptive multitasking
- Priority-based scheduling

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- Windows 10
- x86 assembly language

## 🧮 Target Hardware
- x86 architecture (e.g., Intel 386)

## 🔧 Toolchain
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- Batch scripting

## 🚀 Execution Environment
- Bochs emulator  
- Real x86 hardware (e.g., 386 PC)
