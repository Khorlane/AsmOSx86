# 🧠 AsmOSx86  
*A Hobbyist Operating System in x86 Assembly*

AsmOSx86 is a 32-bit x86 operating system written entirely in NASM assembly and designed to run
in protected mode. Its long-term goal is to provide a fully preemptive, priority-based multitasking
kernel with a clear, minimal, and educational design.
